# Pesto üçÉ

Pesto is a tiny, lightweight, and fast game framework written entirely in C, utilizing Lua for scripting. It's designed to be cross-platform and is dependent on two main libraries: Raylib, an exceptional C library for graphics and input, and Lua. Pesto's architecture and design principles are heavily influenced by the fantastic Love2D framework.

## Introduction

Pesto aims to offer a simpler and more lightweight alternative to Love2D while staying true to the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) principle. The primary motivation behind Pesto's creation was a desire for a lightweight project that emphasized readability, simplicity, and educational value. It aims to be self-contained, minimizing external dependencies and providing a more comprehensive feature set compared to the basic functionality of Love2D.

The word "Pesto" originates from my favorite Italian sauce, the country i'm from üòã.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Built in C without significant dependencies, Pesto can support all platforms that Raylib supports, making it highly versatile.
- **Lightweight**: With a focus on simplicity and a small footprint, Pesto remains fast and efficient.
- **Lua Scripting**: Utilizes Lua for scripting, offering flexibility and ease of use in designing and developing games.
- **Readable Source Code**: Emphasizes readability and simplicity intentionally for educational purposes and easy understanding.
- **Inspired by Love2D**: Draws inspiration from Love2D's ease of use while aiming to be more self-contained.

## Getting Started

To start using Pesto, grab the latest release and refer to the documentation available on the [Pesto website](https://vinnyhorgan.github.io/pesto).

Here is a simple example:

```lua
function pesto.draw()
    pesto.graphics.print("Hello, World!")
end
```

## Building

You can build Pesto from source using CMake. Make sure to clone the project and its submodules, and then follow these steps:

```console
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Differences with Love2D

- **Lightweight & Simplified**: While Love2D is a robust framework, Pesto aims to be more streamlined and less reliant on additional third-party libraries.
- **Maintained Ecosystem**: Leveraging modern libraries, Pesto harnesses the existing ecosystem, staying current with contemporary development practices.
- **Self-Contained Functionality**: Strives to offer a more comprehensive feature set without the need for excessive external dependencies.
