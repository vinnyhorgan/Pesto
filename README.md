# Pesto ![](docs/assets/favicon.png)

> **A tiny lua framework.**

Pesto can be used to create any type of program with ease, thanks to its simple [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) interface.
Programs written in it are lightweight, fast, and cross-platform.
Pesto's main dependency is the amazing [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), and is heavily influenced by the [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) framework.

The primary motivation behind Pesto's creation was a desire for a lightweight project that emphasized readability, simplicity, and educational value.
It aims to be self-contained, minimizing external dependencies and providing a more comprehensive feature set compared to the basic functionality of Love2D.

The word "Pesto" originates from my favorite Italian sauce, the country i'm from ðŸ˜‹.
