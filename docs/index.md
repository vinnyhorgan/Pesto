# Welcome

## Introduction

I began my programming journey at the age of 14, dabbling in web development projects.
However, my true infatuation began with [Love2D](https://love2d.org): an amazing little piece of software.
It captivated me with its **simplicity**: no hefty installer, no dependencies, and a thriving community.
Its embedding of [Lua](https://lua.org) within the executable felt like magic.
Love2D became my go-to for **not just games** but various projects.

## Exploring Other Frameworks

In my quest, I explored various engines and frameworks, each with its strengths and weaknesses:

- **Unity**: Proprietary and bloated, I struggled to finish projects due to its vastness.
- **Unreal Engine**: While powerful, it felt impractical for indie developers due to its resource-heavy nature.
- **Godot**: A better alternative to Unity but overwhelmed me with its features.
- **Monogame/FNA**: Similar to Love2D in philosophy but lacked a strong library community and robust documentation.
- **LibGDX**: Great but reliant on large dependencies like the JVM and Gradle, causing complexities.
- **Game Maker**: Reminiscent of Unity, loaded with features, but lacked intuitive polish.

Exploring even raw C/C++ and OpenGL, I found their productivity limited in comparison to existing rendering libraries.

## Raylib - A Marvelous Find

[Raylib](https://raylib.com) stood out like Love2D: simple, intuitive, with a great community.
However, being primarily a C library, it **lacks the ease of use of other higher level frameworks**, and while it has many language bindings, they are not always up to date.

## Love2D's Shortcomings

While Love2D is what made me fall in love with programming, some things always bothered me:

- Missing core features.
- Reliance on external libraries.
- Sparse learning materials and an outdated feel.
- Absence of 3D support.

These are just minor things, and some are just design decisions of the framework itself, but I always felt like they were limiting.

## Pesto Is Born

After five years in game development, I dreamt of an **ultimate game framework**.
Love2D and Raylib had their merits, but I envisioned a one-size-fits-all tool to empower anyone to bring their creative vision to life with ease.

Pesto aims to merge the best of Love2D and Raylib into a **lightweight**, **fast**, and **Lua-scriptable** framework.
With a simple API, intuitive documentation, and examples, it seeks to be the perfect solution to build **any type of program**.

## Limitless Creativity For Everyone

In a tech landscape with many existing frameworks and engines, Pesto aims to emerge as an open-source, beginner-friendly, and feature-rich platform.
It strives to empower users' creativity while maintaining simplicity and standards.
